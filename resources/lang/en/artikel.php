        'paragraf1' => 'Junk Food is called instant food or fast food which has now developed rapidly in the competition of food companies in Indonesia. Fast food is considered by some to be more time-effective and easy to find. Not only that, fast food has a delicious taste, plus the price is affordable. Fast food has long been controversial in our country because of the disclosure of some of the bad effects it has. The bad impact is caused by the content of harmful substances in instant food, such as the wax in instant noodles. It does not stop there, in fact fast food contains preservatives and flavoring agents which are now called "micin".',
        'paragraf2' => 'The phenomenon of the word "micin" is now suddenly often used by teenagers to adults when someone experiences things that are not normal. The meaning of things that are not normal is like someone who is late in thinking, takes a long time to answer when spoken to, and so on. It cannot be denied, fast food does contain harmful substances as stated above. Several studies have proven that the frequency of consuming fast food alone does not have a direct impact on the body. However, fast food consumed will accumulate in the body which then becomes the cause of deadly diseases such as cancer. Not only cancer, dangerous diseases also lurk, such as stroke, appendicitis, and kidney disease.',
        'paragraf3' => 'So if you are one of those people who only eat fast food, reduce it and start loving your body and yourself. It should be noted that one of the ingredients in instant food, namely wax, is difficult for the body to digest. The wax destroys the working principle of the body is digestive system so that food containing wax will be digested in at least two days.'
